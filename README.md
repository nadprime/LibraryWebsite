# Library Website
## Problem Statement
<b><i>
A Library maintains a website of its members and books issued to those members. The 
website displays the list of the members, number of books issued to them and contact 
number of the members. In addition, it also displays a form for the members who want to 
get a specific book issued. Design and create four web pages for the Library namely, 
Home, Member_List, Book_Registration Form and Feedback, having the following 
features:
  </b></i>
</br>
</br>
<b>
For consistency, every webpage of the website should consist of three basic divisions –
</br>
</br>
Header - This division should be same for all the four web pages and should display 
name and logo of the Library. This division should be in different background 
colour.
</br>
</br>
Menu - This division should be same for every web page. It should contain links to all 
the web pages, viz. Home, Member_List, Book_Registration Form and 
Feedback.
</br>
</br>
Content - This division should display the basic information as given below. The web 
pages that you are designing should differ in this Division only.
</b>
</br>
</br>
<i>
The Content division of the different pages should be as under:
</br>
</br>
a. Home page should include a message from the Librarian, welcoming all the members to 
the website.
</br>
</br>
b. Member_List page should display information about all the members – name of member, 
number of books issued to them and contact number of the members. You should use a 
table to display this information.
</br>
</br>
c. Book_Registration page should contain a form, which should have fields – member 
name, phone number of the member, the title of the book that s/he wants to get issued, 
and a Submit button. You should write JavaScript code to verify that all the fields are 
filled with some data. This code should be run when the Submit button is pressed.
</br>
</br>
d. Feedback page should display another form that has three input fields – Name of 
member, subject of the feedback and a text area for giving the feedback. In addition, this 
form should have a Submit button.
